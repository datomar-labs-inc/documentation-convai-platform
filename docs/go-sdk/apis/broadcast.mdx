Use the ```Broadcast()``` method to send an outgoing message to a set of users. The Broadcast method returns a response and an error (error will not be nil if there's an error). The response has a BroadcastResult type with the status of the broadcast and the number of users who were delivered the broadcast.

The ```Broadcast()``` method expects an input of type **[BroadcastInput]()**.

## Example
1. We have the following setup in Convai. Our link is of **[broadcast type](/convai-studio/links/broadcast-type-link)** with the Broadcast Type as 'broadcast-type-set-in-convai
<img alt="Broadcast Type Setup" src={useBaseUrl('img/node-sdk/methods/broadcast/1.png')} />

2. Then use the following code in your Go project. Make sure you set Broadcast Permission for your API key. Here we want to send a message on Dev Console for yourself. You can get your own super user ID in ```Users > Click on the user > find the super user id above User Data section```
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "encoding/json"
    "github.com/datomar-labs-inc/convai-sdk-go"
)

const API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY"

func main() {
    convaiClient := convai.NewAPIClient(API_KEY)
    cm := convai.NewContextModifier()
    channel := "channel_dev"
    userQuery := *convai.UserQueryBuilder().Any().Where("id").Equals("2a34d08b-fecc-4154-a0ae-eabe6135bbab").Build()

    res, err := convaiClient.Broadcast(&convai.BroadcastInput{
        BroadcastType:   "broadcast-type-set-in-convai",
        ContextModifier: cm,
        Channel:         channel,
        UserQuery:       userQuery,
    })

    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err.Error())
    } else {
        prettyRes, _ := json.MarshalIndent(&res, "", "\t")
		fmt.Println(string(prettyRes))
    }
}
```
#### Example Response
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "users": 1
}
```
