Before using anying methods for Convai, you would need to configure the Convai Client.

You can create an API key from ```Bot > Development > API Keys > Create Key```

```go
import (
    "github.com/datomar-labs-inc/convai-sdk-go"
)

var convaiClient *convai.Client
convaiClient = convai.NewAPIClient(API_KEY)
```
