Nodes are the smallest blocks/steps that define the activity to be performed by the bot.  For example, you can send a message to the user, send user data to a server, collect data from the user, etc.

There are two types of nodes on the Convai platform - Omnichannel nodes and platform-specific nodes. Omnichannel nodes work on all the connected platforms and platform-specific nodes only work on the specified channel.
