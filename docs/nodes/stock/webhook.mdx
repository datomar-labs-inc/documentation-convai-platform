## Usage

The webhook node is used to send a POST request to a URL. The webhook node sends the current execution data along with the user data and expects back a [ContextModifier](../../node-sdk/classes/context-modifier.mdx) Object to do any changes in the context.

## Steps

1. Setup your webhook url. You can directly input it in the webhook node but I have added it in the extensions graph in case I need to change it. You can also add it as an environment variable and then access it using ```{{ e "webhookUrl" }}```.
<img alt="Setup Webhook" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/webhook/1.png')} />

2. Setup your webhook node. Here I am accessing my webhookUrl using ```{{ d "webhookUrl" }}```
<img alt="Setup Webhook" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/webhook/2.png')} />

3. Send the context change back in the response. The response needs to be in a certain format as shown in the following code. If you don't want to do any code change, you can just send an empty object back as the response.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="withoutSdk"
  values={[
    { label: 'Without SDK', value: 'withoutSdk', },
    { label: 'With SDK', value: 'withSdk', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="withoutSdk">

```js
// In our example, we are setting a firstName and lastName for the user as John
// and Snow respectively. Optionally, we are also logging in Convai that we
// have changed the firstName

app.post('/verifyByEmail', (req, res, next) => {

    res.json({
        changes: [
            {
                type: 2,
                op: 0,
                key: 'firstName',
                data: 'John'
            }, {
                type: 2,
                op: 0,
                key: 'lastName',
                data: 'Snow'
            }
        ],
        logs: [
            {
                level: 10,
                message: 'Changed firstName to John',
                time: new Date()
            }
        ],
        errors: []
    });
    
})
```

<TabItem value="withSdk">

```js
const {ContextModifier} = require('convai-sdk')

// In our example, we are setting a firstName and lastName for the user as John
// and Snow respectively. Optionally, we are also logging in Convai that we

app.post('/verifyByEmail', (req, res, next) => {
    let cm = new ContextModifier();

    cm.setUser('firstName', 'John');
    cm.setUser('lastName', 'Snow');
    cm.logInfo('Changed firstName to John');

    res.json(cm);
