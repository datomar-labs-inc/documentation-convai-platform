3. Configure Microsoft Teams integration by entering the Microsoft App ID and password you saved before. Click the Validate button to generate the Messaging Endpoint. Click the Copy URL button to copy the generated Messaging endpoint. Then click Save button to save the integration configuration
<img alt="copy app id and password" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/integrations/channels/ms-teams/image8.png')} />

4. Paste the generated Messaging endpoint in your Azure resource and save it.
<img alt="paste endpoint" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/integrations/channels/ms-teams/image6.png')} />

## Test the bot in Teams
1. In the Azure resource you created, go to Channels page. Under Add a featured Channel, click the Teams button to create Teams Channel.
