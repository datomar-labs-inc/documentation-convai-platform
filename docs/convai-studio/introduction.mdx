## What is Convai Studio?
The Convai Platform is designed to automate conversations between businesses and their customers across multiple messaging channels. It provides the ability to make the chatbot once and launch it on different channels with zero to minimal changes.

## How does the Convai Platform works?
When a user sends a message via any channel, it is first parsed into a Convai readable format using the **Request Node** in the **Extension Graph**. Then it goes through to the **Main Graph** using the **Main Module**. All the bot logic is written in the **Main Graph** using modules, nodes and links. After all the logic in the **Main Graph**, the **Batch Responder** parses the response back into a structure that is understandable by the messaging channel. Everything in Convai is a context modifier. The end result is based on how the context of the current execution is being modified.

## How do I get started?
You can start by creating a bot on [Convai Studio](https://app.convai.studio). In order to get started, you need to be part of an organization. Here is a step by step guide on how to build a simple bot. 

export const GetStarted = ({children}) => (
    <div style={{
        width: '100%',
        padding: '30px 0px'
    }} className="item shadow--md">
        {children}
    </div>
);

export const GetStartedChildren = ({children}) => (
    <div style={{
        textAlign: 'center',
        margin: '0px auto'
    }}>
        {children}
    </div>
)

export const GetStartedChildrenButton = ({href, children}) => (
    <div style={{
        textAlign: 'center',
        marginTop: '20px'
    }}>
        <a href={href} className="button button--secondary button--lg">{children}</a>
