## Usage

Data Equals Links are used to determine the flow by the bot's data. 

It's like an IF block in code. If the check of the Data Equals matches (result is true). The flow goes to the linked node.

<img alt="data equals link" src={useBaseUrl('img/links/data-equals-link/image1.png')} />

Mode is the boolean operation on multiple checks.

You can add checks by clicking on the "+" button. Delete a check by clicking on the "-" button.

Field Type defines the **[Data Scope](/convai-studio/simple-bot/understanding-convai/#data-scope)** to be checked.

Field Name is what your data's key is.

Operations is the specific check condition to be applied on the data.

## Mode

- ```All``` - equivalent to AND (&&)

- ```Any``` - equivalent to OR (||)

- ```None``` - equivalent to NOT (!)

## Operations

- ```Equals``` - checks data with Field Name matches the Value

- ```Not Equals``` - checks data with Field Name does not match the Value

- ```Exists``` - checks data with Field Name exists

- ```Doesn't Exists``` - checks data with Field Name does not exist

- ```==RegExp``` - checks data with Field Name matches the Regular Expression

- ```!=RegExp``` - checks data with Field Name does not match the Regular Expression

- ```Starts With``` - checks data with Field Name's Value starts with the entered Value

- ```Not Starts With``` - checks data with Field Name's Value does not start with the entered Value

- ```Type Of``` - checks data with Field Name matches the pre-defined Regular Expression

- ```Not Type Of```- checks data with Field Name does not match the pre-defined Regular Expression
