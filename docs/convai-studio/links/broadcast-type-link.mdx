## Usage

Broadcast Type link determines the flow when a Broadcast is triggered by the **[Convai SDK Broadcast](/node-sdk/methods/broadcast)** or a **[One Time Broadcast Node](/convai-studio/nodes/stock/one-time-broadcast)** with specified Broadcast Type. This link should always be connected from Trigger System Node to other nodes. Or connected from a Module's Input System Node to other nodes in which the Module is connected to the Trigger System Node on the Main Graph.
