## Usage

Channel Link is used to determine the flow on the channel. That is, if the current channel (we are executing the bot in Facebook/Twilio) is Facebook/Twilio, the flow continues to the node it is connected. 

<img alt="facebook/twilio" src={useBaseUrl('img/links/channel-link/image1.png')} />

If the current channel is Dev Console (we are executing the bot in Dev Console), the flow will not go to the connected Node.

<img alt="dev console" src={useBaseUrl('img/links/channel-link/image2.png')} />

## Mode

You can select multiple channels by Shift+Click

- ```All``` - equivalent to AND (&&)

- ```Any``` - equivalent to OR (||)

- ```None``` - equivalent to NOT (!)
