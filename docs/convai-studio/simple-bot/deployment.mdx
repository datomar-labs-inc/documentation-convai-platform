For best practices, we should use versioning in the bot so in case you update the logic for the graph, it doesnâ€™t affect the production bot.

1. Go to Settings > Version Management

  <img alt="version management" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image113.png')} />

2. Click on Create Version. 


3. Add a version number and changelog and click on publish version. Clicking on publish version, creates a copy of the version which cannot be edited.


4. Now click on edit for the environment that you are using for production. For my case, it was called Production. 


5. Under Version Select, select a version and click on Set Version.

  <img alt="set version" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image114.png')} />

6. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Click on CHANGE to confirm.
