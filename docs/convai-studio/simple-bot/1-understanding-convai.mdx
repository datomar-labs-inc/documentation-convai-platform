Before we start, let's understand some of the concepts/pre-requisites required to make bots on Convai. 

## Organizations, Accounts and Permissions

### Accounts
An account is a single email account that has access to the Convai Platform

### Organizations
Each bot is part of an organization. Each email account is therefore a part of an organization and has access to a bot as long as they are in the organization. 

Accounts and Organizations are like a many-to-many relationship which means that each organization can have multiple accounts under them and each account can be a part of multiple organizations. For example, my email is a part of 2 organizations:
<img alt="Create Bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image2.png')} />

### Permissions
There are 2 levels of permissions in Convai. Organization level permissions and Bot level permissions.

#### Organization Level Permissions
The organization permission settings are accessible at Organizations > Select an organization > Organization Permissions.

- **Account Permissions** - Accounts with these permissions can add and remove accounts from an organization.
- **Bot Permissions** - Accounts with these permissions can add, edit and delete every bot in the organization.

:::note
System Admin permissions are currently on Convai level and can only be managed by Datomar Labs.

#### Bot level permissions

Bot level permissions are there to provide access for a bot to an account. The bot permission settings are accessible at Bots > Select a bot > Settings > Bot Permissions. The account in this case doesn’t need to be a part of the organization. Each account in the Bot permissions has the view permissions for the bot.

- **Edit** Bot - Can edit a bot
- **Edit** environments - Can edit an environment
- **Delete** environments - Can delete an environment

## Environments
Most of the bot settings are configurable at an environment level. Consider an environment as a Github branch and the bot as a Github repository. Just like the build of a project is dependent on the branch, the build of a bot is dependent on the environment.

A Development Environment is added to every bot by default. To create an environment:

1. Go to Bots > Select a bot > Settings > Create Environment
2. Click on Create Environment
3. Add a name for the environment (For example, Production)
4. Click on Create

<img className="mb--10" alt="Create an environment" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image5.png')} />

Each environment has the following settings:

- Name and Session Length
- Version Select (this is only visible if the bot has at least 1 version. We will talk about versions in the deployment section)
- Environment Variables
- Integrations

## Integrations

Convai offers a lot of different types of integrations like NLP, CMS, Channels, Analytics, etc. We are adding more as we go. Integrations are currently only managed and available by the Convai team. You can add your own using Convai's scripting and SDK on a per bot basis. Read more in the integrations section.

## Graphs, Modules, Nodes and Links

### Graphs
Graphs are like a file in a program that contains all the logic. Convai has 3 type of graphs:
:::info Note
Graphs are only available for the Development environment.
:::

#### 1. Extension Graph
Extension Graph is where the incoming and outgoing requests are processed. Incoming request is parsed into a convai readable format. All the requests are converted into a context format that is manipulated later in other graphs. At the end, the outgoing request is parsed depending on the channel the request came from.

#### 2. Main Graph
All the bot logic is defined in the Main graph. The request from the Extension graph is passed to the Main graph where the context is manipulated based on the logic. The best practice is to split the logic into smaller reusable modules.

#### 3. Module Graph
Module graphs are dynamic graphs generated for each module.

### Modules
Modules are structured reusable bot logic that is used to perform a single or set of actions. In a typical programming world, modules are like functions. In Convai, there are 2 types of modules:
:::info Note
Extension Graph doesn’t support User Made Modules
:::

#### System Modules
System modules are added to the graphs by default. These modules cannot be deleted or used again. Currently there is only **1** System module - Main. Main is present in the Extension Graph. This is the module which later gets converted to the Main Graph.

#### User Made Modules
These modules are made by the users and are reusable in the same bot. The modules can be added anywhere as needed (_except for Extension Graph_).

### Nodes
Nodes are the smallest blocks/steps that define the activity to be performed by the bot. For example, you can send a message to the user, send user data to a server, collect data from the user, etc. In a typical programming world, nodes are like a single line of code to perform an action. There are 3 type of nodes present in Convai:

#### System Nodes
System nodes, just like system modules, are added to the graphs by default. These nodes cannot be deleted from a graph.

- **Request Node on Extension Graph**: Request Node is used to parse the request from a channel into a Convai understandable format.

- **Trigger Node on Extension Graph**: Trigger Node is used to handle broadcasts sent directly from Convai or from a third-party server using the API/SDK.

- **Batch Responder Node on Extension Graph**: Batch Responder is used to parse the response back to the channel that initiated the request.

- **Start Node on Main Graph**: Start Node is fired when a user initiates a bot using an action other than text. For example, this node will be fired when the user clicks on the call button for an IVR connected to Convai or when the user clicks on web chat for the first time.

:::danger Note
Facebook's Get Started button is not currently supported by the Start node
:::

- **Any Time Node on Main Graph**: Any Time node is the point of receiver for all the requests incoming from the Extension Graph (except for the requests received by Start Node and Trigger Node).

- **Trigger Node on Main Graph**: Trigger Node receives the request from the Trigger node in the Extension Graph. 

- **Input Node on User Made Module Graph**: Input Node is the entry point to recieve the current execution context for a module.

#### Stock Nodes
Stock nodes are platform wide nodes that are available for all the bots irrespective of the settings. To read more about stock nodes, refer to the [nodes documentation](../nodes/introduction).

#### Channel Nodes
Channel nodes are platform wide nodes that are dependent on your environment settings. Channel nodes are only available after you have added the channel from the integrations section of your environment settings.

### Links
Links are logic gates between the nodes. Links can be compared to the Conditional Logic statements. They are basically if-else loops

## Data Scope
In Convai, we store data in four different scopes:

- Execution: Execution data is stored for a single execution. This data is tracked from the moment the request enters Convai till it leaves. If you are using an input node to wait for user data, note that all the execution data that was saved before the input node will not be available once the user provides their input. To reference/use execution data in any node, refer to the documentation of that node.

- Session: Session data is stored for a single session. This data is tracked from the time a user interacts with the bot until the session expires. Session data is valid for 24 hours by default but the settings can be changed under the [environment settings](#environments). To reference/use session data in any node, refer to the documentation of that node.

- User: User data is considered as persistent data, it exists as long as the user exists. To reference/use user data in any node, refer to the documentation of that node.

- Module: Module data is only accessible in a module. This data is like setting up variables that can be used later in the module. The module data is initialized when the instance of the module is initialized. To reference/use module data in any node, refer to the documentation of that node.

## Summary
Here is an analogy for easy understanding. Keep this analogy in mind and it will be easier as we proceed further.
<img className="mb--10" alt="Create Bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image1.png')} />

- Organization - Github team
- Bot - Github Repository
- Bot Environment - Github branch
- Graph - Consider a Graph as a file where different modules are written.
- Modules - A module is like a function. It is a defined collection of a Bot logic that is reusable everywhere in the graph
- Links - Links can be compared to the Conditional Logic statements. They are basically if-else loops
- Nodes - Nodes are like a single line of code. It defines the logic of how the context is being modified. (or any other action in the bot)
