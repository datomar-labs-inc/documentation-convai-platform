Before we start, let's understand some of the concepts/pre-requisites required to make bots on Convai. 

## Analogy for easy understanding
Here is an analogy for easy understanding. Keep this analogy in mind and it will be easier as we proceed further.

- Organization - Github team
- Bot - Github Repository
- Bot Environment - Github branch
- Graph - Consider a Graph as a file where different modules are written.
- Modules - A module is like a function. It is a defined collection of a Bot logic that is reusable everywhere in the graph
- Links - Links can be compared to the Conditional Logic statements. They are basically if-else loops
- Nodes - Nodes are like a single line of code. It defines the logic of how the context is being modified. (or any other action in the bot)

## Understanding Organizations, Accounts and Permissions

### Accounts
An account is a single email account that has access to the Convai Platform

### Organizations
Each bot is part of an organization. Each email account is therefore a part of an organization and has access to a bot as long as they are in the organization. 

Accounts and Organizations are like a many-to-many relationship which means that each organization can have multiple accounts under them and each account can be a part of multiple organizations. For example, my email is a part of 2 organizations:
<img alt="Create Bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image2.png')} />

### Permissions
There are 2 levels of permissions in Convai. Organization level permissions and Bot level permissions.

#### Organization Level Permissions
The organization permission settings are accessible at Organizations > Select an organization > Organization Permissions.

- **Account Permissions** - Accounts with these permissions can add and remove accounts from an organization.
- **Bot Permissions** - Accounts with these permissions can add, edit and delete every bot in the organization.

:::note
System Admin permissions are currently on Convai level and can only be managed by Datomar Labs.

#### Bot level permissions

Bot level permissions are there to provide access for a bot to an account. The bot permission settings are accessible at Bots > Select a bot > Settings > Bot Permissions. The account in this case doesnâ€™t need to be a part of the organization. Each account in the Bot permissions has the view permissions for the bot.

- **Edit** Bot - Can edit a bot
- **Edit** environments - Can edit an environment
- **Delete** environments - Can delete an environment

## Understanding Environments
Most of the bot settings are configurable at an environment level. Consider an environment as a Github branch and the bot as a Github repository. Just like the build of a project is dependent on the branch, the build of a bot is dependent on the environment.

A Development Environment is added to every bot by default. To create an environment:

1. Go to Bots > Select a bot > Settings > Create Environment
2. Click on Create Environment
3. Add a name for the environment (For example, Production)
4. Click on Create

<img className="mb--10" alt="Create an environment" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image5.png')} />

Each environment has the following settings:

- Name and Session Length
- Version Select (this is only visible if the bot has at least 1 version. We will talk about versions in the deployment section)
- Environment Variables
- Integrations

## Integrations

Convai offers a lot of different type of integrations like NLP, CMS, Analytics etc. We are adding more as we go. For the tutorial, add:

1. Facebook and Twilio for the channel
2. Dialogflow for NLP
3. Dashbot for Analytics
