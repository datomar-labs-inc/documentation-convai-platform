New to Convai? Start from [Understanding Convai](./understanding-convai) guide.

## Data Scope (You can come back to this section later)

In Convai, we store data in three different scopes - context(execution), session, user.
Context(execution) data only exists in an execution(before the next user input).
Session data by default exists 24 hours, and you are able to change the session length in the bot’s settings.
User data is considered as persistent data, it exists as long as the user exists.
In Set Data Node, we use the prefix “d.”, “s.”, “u.” before the key of the data to announce the data is in Context(Execution) Scope, Session Scope or User Scope.

## Build a chat bot with NLP and use External APIs
1. Login to Convai Studio.

2. Click on the “Make Bot” Button to begin making your bot.

  <img alt="make bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image78.png')} />

3. In the name field enter “Tutorial Bot”.

  <img alt="create tutorial bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image103.png')} />

4. After the bot is created, you will be taken to the bot’s Dashboard by default. Click on the double right arrow button at the bottom of the left side panel to view different Side Navigation(we will refer to it as Nav by short) of this bot.
    
  <img alt="nav collapsed" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image44.png')} />

  <img alt="nav expanded" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image29.png')} />

5. Go to Graph in the Nav. The majority of the work with your bot will take place here. You can zoom in/out using your mouse’s wheel and left-click drag on empty space to move your view of the graph..

  <img alt="graph overview" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image66.png')} />

6. In this tutorial we will be making a quiz bot that uses NLP and External API. Let’s add the NLP integration as a starting point. You can always check the Integrations document if you don’t understand what we are doing here. Here we will use DialogFlow as the bot’s NLP. 

  Go to Settings from Nav. 

  <img alt="to settings" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image99.png')} />

  Under the Development Environment section, click on Edit

  <img alt="edit development" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image17.png')} />

  Scroll down to the bottom to find the Integrations section, select DialogFlow and then click on the DialogFlow Configuration, import the DialogFlow JSON file and click on Save.

  <img alt="select dialogflow" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image57.png')} />

  <img alt="dialogflow selected" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image31.png')} />

  <img alt="dialogflow config" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image7.png')} />

7. The bot’s NLP Integration is set. Let’s go back to the graph via Nav.

  Go to Extension Graph by clicking on the Extension Paginator

  <img alt="go to extension" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image107.png')} />

  <img alt="extension graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image9.png')} />

  Add the DialogFlow Node to the graph. Connect it between the Request Node and Main Node for NLP to function.

  <img alt="add dialogflow node" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image16.png')} />

  Now you are able to use NLP from Intent Links by selecting the DialogFlow intents

  <img alt="intent link" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image95.png')} />

  <img alt="select intent" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image80.png')} />

8. Back to the Main Graph by clicking the Paginator
  Create a Module from the Context Menu by right clicking anywhere on the graph

  <img alt="create module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image47.png')} />

  Rename the Module as “Get Questions”, and connect it to the Any Time System Node

  <img alt="rename module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image33.png')} />

  Click on the link, change the link type to Intent Link, select AskQuestion(DialogFlow) as the Intent. Any User Input from the Any Time Node that matches this intent will proceed to the Get Questions Module.

  <img alt="select ask question intent" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image50.png')} />

  <img alt="graph of module and intent link" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image104.png')} />

  The AskQuestion Intent in DialogFlow looks like this:

  <img alt="ask question intent contents" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image75.png')} />

  The “triviacategory” entity will be used in the script to call the Trivia API to get quiz questions in different categories. This parameter will be saved in the execution scope.

  <img alt="triviacategory entity" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image35.png')} />

  Double click on the Get Question Module to get inside its graph.

  <img alt="get question graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image37.png')} />

  Click on the Input Node, add a Module Variable like the following for the script to use

  <img alt="set mod var" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image15.png')} />

  Create a Script Node from Context Menu and Rename it as “Get Questions”, link it to the Input Node of this Module.

  <img alt="new node" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image38.png')} />

  <img alt="stock node" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image72.png')} />

  <img alt="script node" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image81.png')} />

  Fill the following code in the Script Node:

  ```js
  const axios = require('axios');
  
  module.exports = async function main() {
      try {
          let amount = modvars.qAmount; //module variable
          
          //get triviacategory from Context Data
          let category = ctx.get("triviacategory"); 
          category = category || '';
          
          //set up the baseUrl for API call
          let baseUrl = `https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=${amount}&category=${category}`;
          
          let {data} = await axios.get(baseUrl);
          let questions = data.results;
          
          //set Session Data questions equal to the result from API Call
          setSession("questions", questions)
      } catch (e) {
          console.error(e.message)
      }
  }
  ```

  :::tip Note
  Here we used [AXIOS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) as the HTTP library to call the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to get Quiz questions and store data of questions in the [Session Scope Data](#data-scope-you-can-come-back-to-this-section-later). Script in Script Node is basically JavaScript, you can use AXIOS or any other HTTP libraries to call external APIs. You can read the document about [Script Node](/convai-studio/nodes/stock/script) if you want to know what the script does exactly here.
  :::

9. Go to the Dev Console on the Right Side Panel (we will refer to it as Side Panel for short). Type “Ask a film question” and hit Enter. Click on View under the bot’s response, scroll down a little bit to inspect the Session Data and the Entity we got from DialogFlow, that is what the Script Node did for us.

  <img alt="get question exec" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image74.png')} />

  <img alt="triviacategory data" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image59.png')} />

  <img alt="question in session data" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image39.png')} />

  If the AskQuestion Intent did not match, session data will look like this

  <img alt="ask question intent no match" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image60.png')} />

10. We have the Get Question Module Ready, let’s add another Module named “Ask Question” on the Main Graph, connect it after the Get Question Module. Double click to enter its graph. 
  
  <img alt="add ask question module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image105.png')} />

  Make the module's graph like below:

  <img alt="ask question module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image42.png')} />

  Edit the script of Format Question Script Node:

  ```js
  const _ = require('lodash');

  module.exports = async function main() {
      try {
        
          //for challenge, save the index
          let index = ctx.session.get("index");
          let currentQuestion = {};
          if(index === undefined){
              index = 0;
          }
          
          //get one question from Session Data
          q = ctx.session.get('questions')[index];
        
          let options = [];
        
          //set question type in Context Data
          //multiple choice or true/false
          if (q.type === "boolean") {
              set("type", "tf");
          } else {
              set("type", "mc");
          }
        
          options.push(q.correct_answer);
        
          q.incorrect_answers.forEach(o => options.push(o));
    
          //shuffle the answer options
          options = _.shuffle(options);
    
          options.forEach((o, i) => {
              if (o === q.correct_answer) {
                  currentQuestion.correctIndex = i;
              }
          });
        
          //replace character code to character
          question = _.replace(_.replace(q.question, "&quot;", '"'), "&", "&amp;");
    
          //put the currentQuestion things in one object
          currentQuestion.options = options;
          currentQuestion.question = question;
          currentQuestion.correctAnswer = q.correct_answer;
        
          //set currentQuestion in Session Data
          setSession("currentQuestion", currentQuestion);
      } catch (e) {
          console.log(e.message);
      }
  }
  ```
  :::tip Note
  Here we used the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) utility library to format quiz questions. As mentioned before, Script Node is just JavaScript, you can use any JavaScript features here.
  :::

  Edit Question Response Node:

    ```xml
    <response>
        <message typing="1">
        <text>{{ session.data.question }}
        {%- for op in session.data.options -%}
                    {{- forloop.index -}}. {{ op }}
        {% endfor %}
        </text>
        {% for op in session.data.options %}
                    <qr value="{{ forloop.index | minus: 1 }}">{{ op }}</qr>
            {% endfor %}
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    The Response Node is in [Liquid Template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). The preview of this response will look like this:

    <img alt="response preview" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image91.png')} />

    Edit Validate Answer Script Node:

    ```js
    module.exports = async function main() {
        //user input
        txt = ctx.text.replace("%s+", "");
        //correct index
        correct = ctx.session.get("currentQuestion").correctIndex;
        
        if (txt == correct) {
            set("correct", true);
        } else {
            set("incorrect", true);
        }
    }
    ```

    Edit Correct, Incorrect Response Nodes:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Correct! Added 1 to your score.</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Incorrect! Subtracted 1 to your score.</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    Edit Update Point Script Node:
    ```js
    module.exports = async function main() {
        //get point from User Data
        point = ctx.user.get("point");
        
        //set point to 0 if it does not exist
        if (point === undefined) {
            point = 0;
        }
        
        //get correct or incorrect from Context Data
        if (ctx.get("correct")) {
            point++;
        }else if (ctx.get("incorrect")){
            point--;
        }else {
            point += 0;
        }
        
        //set point in User Data
        setUser("point",point);
    }
    ```

    Notice that Validate Answer Script Node has two links to two Response Nodes. We need to take some action on these links otherwise the flow of the graph will always go to the Correct Response Node.
    
    Review the script code in Validate Answers Script Node, it sets the execution scope variable “correct” to true if the answer is correct, otherwise it sets “incorrect” to true. We can take this as an advantage in Data Equals Link (Actually the Validate Answers Script Node is intended to do so). 
    ```js
    module.exports = async function main() {
        //user input
        txt = ctx.text.replace("%s+", "");
        //correct index
        correct = ctx.session.get("currentQuestion").correctIndex;
        
        if (txt == correct) {
            set("correct", true);
        } else {
            set("incorrect", true);
        }
    }
    ```

    Set the link between Validate Answer Script Node and Correct Response Node to be Data Equals Link. Set Field Type as Data, Field Name as “correct”, Operation as Exists.

    <img alt="correct link" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image88.png')} />

    Set the link between Validate Answer Script Node and Incorrect Response Node to be Data Equals Link. Set Field Type as Data, Field Name as “incorrect”, Operation as Exists.

    <img alt="incorrect link" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image30.png')} />

    After the bot updates the user’s point, the stored quiz questions in Session Data are no longer useful. These data should be deleted (clean up). So we add a Delete Data Node at the end of this Module.

    <img alt="delete current question" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image3.png')} />
  
    Back to the Main Graph, add a Delete Data Node after the Ask Questions Module.

    <img alt="delete current question" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image87.png')} />

  :::info Note
  We will explain why we don’t delete s.questions inside the Ask Questions Module in the next section.
  :::

  You can inspect that after the user answers the quiz question, questions stored in Session Data are cleared.

  <img alt="session data before delete" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image40.png')} />

  <img alt="session data cleared" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image19.png')} />

11. Go to Dev Console in the Side Panel, send “Ask a film question” to the bot. The Bot will respond with the quiz question and you can play with it.

    <img alt="execution result in this section" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image58.png')} />

    Congratulations, you have built your first Convai chatbot. In this section, you have learned how to use NLP via intent links, and how to call external APIs via Script Nodes. In the next section, we will enhance the bot by reusing the modules you created in this section, and give you an image on how convenient to develop a bot with Modules.
    
    The Main graph looks like this at the end of this section:

    <img alt="graph in this section" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image4.png')} />
  

## Enhance the Tutorial Bot
In this section, we are going to add a challenge feature which allows the user to answer ten quiz questions and show the user’s final score. And a Get Point feature allows the user to get its points and reset it. And Finally, add a welcome message to give a hint to the user on how to interact with the bot.

1. On the Main Graph, create a module named “Challenge” and connect it to Any Time System Node with Challenge intent Link, enter its graph.

    <img alt="add challenge module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image24.png')} />

    The Challenge Intent in DialogFlow:

    <img alt="challenge intent contents" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image102.png')} />

    Create the graph like below (Set Loop Index is a Set Data Node):

    <img alt="challenge module graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image14.png')} />

    Notice that we are reusing the module we created before - Get Questions and Ask Question Module (Modules has an icon on its top-left corner). When you develop your own bot, think carefully about how to modularize your bot functionalities so that you can reuse them anywhere you need, this makes the development process very flexible.
    Edit the Challenge Starts Response Node:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Let's start the challenge!</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    Remember in the Main graph, the Get Questions Module is connected to the Any Time system Node with AskQuestion intent link. Think Any Time Node as a User Input Node. Therefore, set the link between the User Input Node and Get Questions Module to be AskQuestion intent link.

    <img alt="set ask question intent link" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image25.png')} />

    Click on the Get Questions Module, edit its module variable “qAmount” to 10 in order to get 10 questions from the Trivia API.

    <img alt="set qAmount to 10" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image100.png')} />

    We have got 10 quiz questions from the Get Questions Module, then we need the user to answer these 10 questions. However, the Ask Question Module only asks and lets the user answer one question. Using a loop to loop 10 times of the Ask Question Module is a straightforward strategy here.
    
    Edit the Set Loop Index Set Data Node:

    <img alt="set loop index" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image2.png')} />

    Edit Index++ Script Node:
    ```js
    module.exports = async function main() {
        //get index from Session Data
        let index = ctx.session.get("index");
        index++;
        //set index in Session Data
        setSession("index",index);
    }
    ```

    We need to determine when the loop is finished by using Data Equals Link.

    <img alt="end loop" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image43.png')} />

    This loop can be illustrated in the following pseudo-code
    ```js
    index = 0 // Set Loop Index Node
    start loop
        Ask Questions
        index++  // Index++ Node
        if (index == 10)
            end loop 
    -> Delete Data Node
    ```

    Edit Delete Data Node:

    <img alt="delete index and questions" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image61.png')} />

    Remember that we have deleted s.currentQuestions inside the Ask Question Module, if we delete s.questions we got from the API call in that module then we are not able to make the bot ask the next 9 questions in the Challenge Module. So we delete s.questions outside of the Ask Question Module.
    Edit Final Score Response Node:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>You have finished the challenge. Your final score is: {{user\.data\.point}}</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    The execution of Challenge Module:

    <img alt="challenge module execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image1.gif')} />

2. We have the Challenge Module ready, now we need a Get Point Module for the user to get its score or reset it. Create this Module on the Main graph and connect it to Any Time system Node with GetPoints intent link.

    <img alt="add get points" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image36.png')} />

    GetPoints Intent in DialogFlow:

    <img alt="get points intent contents" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image45.png')} />

    Inside the module, create the graph (Reset Point is Set Data Node):

    <img alt="get points graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image23.png')} />

    Edit Your Score Response Node:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Your Score is: {{user.data.point}}
    Do you want to reset your score to Zero?
    </text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    This Response Prompts the user to reset its point or not. Use Affirm intent link to ensure that the flow goes to Reset Point Node if the user confirms to reset its point. Otherwise prompt a Continue message.

    <img alt="continue or reset" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image97.png')} />
    
    Edit Reset Point Set Data Node:

    <img alt="reset point" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image69.png')} />

    Edit Continue Response Node:

    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>You can continue on what you want to do.</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    Edit Reseted Point Response Node:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Your score is set to Zero!</text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

    The execution of Get Point Module:

    <img alt="get point execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image84.png')} />

3. The main functionalities of this bot is set. But we do need a welcome message. A user is new to this bot, and has completely no idea how this bot works. Welcome message is an essential tool.

  Create the Welcome Response Node, link it to Start and Any Time System Node with Welcome intent link.

  <img alt="add welcome" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image55.png')} />
    
  Welcome Intent in DialogFlow:

  <img alt="welcome intent contents" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image8.png')} />

  Edit the Welcome Response Node:
  ```xml
  <response>
      <message>
          <text>Hi I am the trivia bot. How can I help you?</text>
      </message>
  </response>
  ```
  
  This is just a demonstration of the welcome message, you can add more information to optimize user experience.

  The overall execution of the enhanced Tutorial Bot:

  <img alt="overall execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image82.png')} />

4. That’s it! You have learned how to create a bot with NLP and External APIs, and how to use Modules to make your development process flexible. Now let’s proceed to integrate the bot into Facebook

## Facebook Channel
In this section, we will integrate the bot into Facebook so that you can chat to the bot on Facebook.

1. In Convai, go to Settings via Side Nav. Add Facebook integration, leave the configurations blank and save it. For now you have Facebook and DialogFlow integrations.

  <img alt="add facebook integration" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image98.png')} />

2. Login to [Facebook for Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/). Click on My Apps

7. Now the bot is integrated in Facebook Channel, you don’t need to do anything else, it just works. Let’s test it out.

8. Login to Messenger with your Facebook Developer Account, start a New Message, enter the bot’s name (Convai Tutorial Bot, or your own Facebook App name).

  <img alt="facebook execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image107.gif')} />

## Analytics Integration
Convai by itself has a Dashboard of Analytics, but you can use other chatbot analytics, such as Dashbot. In this section, we will use Dashbot integration to extend the Analytics in the bot.

1. In Convai, go to settings, add Dashbot integration, leave the Dashbot API Key configuration empty.

  <img alt="dashbot integration" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image12.png')} />

2. Login to Dashbot, click on Add Chatbot.

  <img alt="add chatbot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image11.png')} />

  Fill in the bot’s name and select “Universal” as the Dashbot platform. Click on Register.

  <img alt="chatbot configs" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image46.png')} />

3. Copy the API key into Convai’s integration configuration and Save it.

  <img alt="copy api key" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image92.png')} />

  <img alt="paste api key" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image76.png')} />

4. Back to the bot’s graph. Go to Extension Graph via Paginator.

  Add a Dashbot Node by Context Menu and make the graph like below

  <img alt="add dashbot node" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image16.png')} />

5. In Dashbot under the Integration Code Section, click View Reports to go to the Dashboard.
  
  <img alt="view reports" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image34.png')} />

  <img alt="dashboard" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image62.png')} />

6. Back to Convai. Do some simple execution in the Dev Console.

  <img alt="simple execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image27.png')} />

  In Dashbot dashboard, you can see that the Live Message Rate has changed, and in Recent Transcripts, there’s a “dev-console-...” which means Dashbot has recorded the transcript of the Dev Console execution in Convai. The other one is the just the execution we tested for our Facebook integration.

  <img alt="analytics" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image63.png')} />

## User Experience
Let’s take a tour back to the execution of the bot we built. You may already find out that it is ambiguous for new users of this bot. In this section, we will optimize the bot’s response and add some Fallbacks to unknown User Inputs. By the way, you don’t need to do any other work for Facebook Channel as Convai does it for you, it just works!

1. Go to the Main Graph of the bot

  Observe the graph, you can find that there’s a situation we did not handle. When the user input is not one of the intents in the graph, the bot will not respond.

  <img alt="enhanced bot graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image83.png')} />

  In Dev Console, we are able to see this No responses received message, but not in other Channels like Facebook. We need to handle this by using Fallback.

  <img alt="no response" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image79.png')} />

2. Create a new Module named “Fallback”. Connect it to the Any Time System Node with a basic link - user input is anything other than the intents we have on other modules and nodes. 

  <img alt="add fallback module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image85.png')} />

  Edit the graph of the Fallback Module:

  <img alt="fallback module graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image106.png')} />

  Edit the General Fallback Response Node:
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Sorry, I don't understand.</text>
            <qr value="ask a question">A single Quiz</qr>
            <qr value="challenge me">Challenge 10 Quizzes</qr>
            <qr value="what is my point">Check your score</qr>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

  The Preview of this Response looks like this:

  <img alt="fallback response preview" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image26.png')} />

  This response uses Quick Reply. Quick Replies gives the user a convenient way to send predefined messages to the bot by clicking on them. Use this wisely as the user may rely solely on quick reply, in our case, the “Ask a question” quick reply asks a question of random category for a user to answer. The bot is capable of user inputs like “Ask sports questions”, this is more about the prompt for user input, we will discuss it later.

3. By its nature, Fallback should always be considered after a User Input Node (as well as Any Time System Node which we have covered). But sometimes it is not necessary. For example in Ask Question Module, we validate user input which gives only two results - correct or incorrect answer in the Validate Answer Script Node. The execution flow is closed, unlike the flow in the Main graph before we added the Fallback Module.

  <img alt="ask question module no fallback" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image96.png')} />

4. We can find the execution flow through the User Input Node in the Challenge Module is not closed. Users could input anything that does not match the AskQuestion Intent. We can use Quick Replies in Challenge Starts Response Node, but this makes the AskQuestion Intent meaningless and there are too many categories of questions, we might need to add a bunch of redundant Quick Replies. So we need a Fallback to handle this. 

  Connect the Fallback Module to the User Input Node.

  <img alt="connect to user input" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image10.png')} />

  But the General Fallback Response does not fit in this situation. Because all we want is to prompt the user input to match AskQuestion intent.

  <img alt="general fallback no good" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image28.png')} />

  We need another Fallback Response for this situation. Add a Module Variable in Fallback Module. This makes sure the bot knows which Fallback Response it should go to.

  <img alt="add mod var" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image108.png')} />

  Edit Fallback Module in Challenge Module

  <img alt="edit mod var" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image111.png')} />

  Edit Fallback Module. If m.comingModule = general, Fallback responds with the General Fallback Message. If m.comingModule = challenge, Fallback responds with Challenge Fallback Message.

  <img alt="edit fallback module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image109.png')} />

  <img alt="edit fallback module" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image110.png')} />

  Edit Challenge Fallback Response Node
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Sorry, I don't understand.
            
    Type "ask [category] questions" to start challenge

    [category] can be any category of questions you'd like to challenge, or you can just type "ask questions" to challenge questions from random categories.
    </text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

5. Using Fallback optimizes User Experience when the user input something wrong. And it is the bot developer’s responsibility to let users know how to do things right. That means we need to tell the user how to do things correctly in ANY Response Node that prompts a user input.

  Go to Main Graph, edit the Welcome Response Node
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Hi, I am the trivia bot.
            
    You can do a quiz question by type "ask a [category name or nothing] question". 
            
    And I can make you a challenge of 10 questions, type "challenge me".

    If you want to know your point, type "what is my point"
    </text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

  Go to Challenge Module, edit the Challenge Starts Response Node
    ```xml
    <response>
        <message>
            <text>Preparing challenge...

    Type "ask [category or nothing] questions" to start the challenge		
    </text>
        </message>
    </response>
    ```

6. The overall execution of the User Experience Optimized bot
