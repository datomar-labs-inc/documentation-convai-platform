<img alt="Create Bot" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/image6.png')} />

4. After the bot is created, you will be taken to the bot’s graph.

## 2. Adding NLP and Analytics

NLP and Analytics nodes are usually added in the Extension Graph. This is so the intent can be discovered before the request and we can log the request using analytics just before we send the response back to the channel.
