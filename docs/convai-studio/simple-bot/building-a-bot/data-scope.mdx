New to Convai? Start from [Understanding Convai](./understanding-convai) guide.

In Convai, we store data in three different scopes - context(execution), session, user.
Context(execution) data only exists in an execution(before the next user input).
Session data by default exists 24 hours, and you are able to change the session length in the bot’s settings.
User data is considered as persistent data, it exists as long as the user exists.
In Set Data Node, we use the prefix “d.”, “s.”, “u.” before the key of the data to announce the data is in Context(Execution) Scope, Session Scope or User Scope.
