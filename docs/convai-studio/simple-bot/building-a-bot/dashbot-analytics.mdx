Convai by itself has a Dashboard of Analytics, but you can use other chatbot analytics, such as Dashbot. In this section, we will use Dashbot integration to extend the Analytics in the bot. 

To integrate Dashbot Analytics. Check the [Dashbot Integration](/convai-studio/integrations/analytics/dashbot).

1. After you successfully integrated Dashbot. Go back to the bot’s graph. Go to Extension Graph via Paginator.

  Add a Dashbot Node by Context Menu and make the graph like below

2. In Dashbot under the Integration Code Section, click View Reports to go to the Dashboard.

  <img alt="dashboard" src={useBaseUrl('img/convai-studio/simple-bot/building-bot/image62.png')} />

3. Back to Convai. Do some simple execution in the Dev Console.

  In Dashbot dashboard, you can see that the Live Message Rate has changed, and in Recent Transcripts, there’s a “dev-console-...” which means Dashbot has recorded the transcript of the Dev Console execution in Convai. The other one is the just the execution we tested for our Facebook integration.
