## Usage

The Merge Users node is used to merge 2 users on different channels into single super user.

Let's say a user has in the past interacted with the bot on SMS and on Facebook. Now when they provide their phone number via facebook, we know that it is the same user and we can merge the two user profiles.

## Steps

1. Setup an intent in Dialogflow to capture the phone numbers. In the example, we have named it PhoneNumber. We have also used Dialogflow's PhoneNumber system entity to extract the phone number.

2. Dialogflow returns the phone number in the ```PhoneNumber``` parameter which can then be extracted using ```{{data.PhoneNumber}}```
