## Usage

The input node is used to gather text input from the user. Usually we need to connect it between two Response Nodes, one for asking, the other for answering. The input node is a sign of a new execution. The flow pauses until user input text is given.

Convai provides you a quick short cut to create an Input Node from the Context Menu. ```right click to invoke Context Menu > Create Input```. The created Input Node is named **User Input** to distinguish from the **Input System Node** in Modules.
