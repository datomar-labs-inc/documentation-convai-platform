## Usage

The Add Channel User node is used to add another channel for a super user. Usually we use this node to add Twilio SMS or Twilio Voice channel to the super user. 

For example, let's assume a user is talking to the bot on Dev Console and it provides its phone number. Now in order to reach it via sms in future, you can add a channel for it and save it.

_**It is important to note that Add Channel User automatically adds the new channel in the same Super User so we don't need to use the Merge Users node.**_

## Example
:::warning Warning
Note: This graph is made only for demonstration in the simplest form, Add Channel User will generate errors. You need to handle them by using **[Error Link](/convai-studio/links/error-link)** and some Fallback logic.
:::

1. Make a graph as below, make sure you have **[Twilio Integration](/convai-studio/integrations/channels/twilio)** set:
    - Ask Phone, Chan User Created are Response Nodes
    - User Input is Input Node
    - Set Data is Set Data Node
    - Add Channel User is Add Channel User Node

    <img alt="example graph" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image1.png')} />

2. Configuration of Ask Phone Node:

    <img alt="Ask Phone Node" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image2.png')} />

3. Configuration of Set Data Node:

    <img alt="Set Data Node" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image3.png')} />

4. Configuration of Add Channel User Node:

    <img alt="Add Channel User Node" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image4.png')} />

5. Configuration of Chan User Created Node, the Twilio SMS and Twilio Voice configurations are using **[Ace Editor]()**, so we can access the execution data there :

    <img alt="Chan User Created Node" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image5.png')} />

6. Execute in the Dev Console

    <img alt="execution" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image6.png')} />

7. Check the user ```Side Nav > Users > Click on the User```. The Twilio SMS Channel is added to that super user.

    <img alt="added channel user" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image7.png')} />

## Bonus
A good practice of this node is add Twilio Voice Channel to the super user when the user is talking to the bot through Twilio SMS channel, and vice versa.

<img alt="added voice/sms user" src={useBaseUrl('img/nodes/stock/add-channel-user/image8.png')} />


## Configuration

The configuration of the node is as defined below:

| Name          | Required |                      Description                                     |

| Title         | Required | The title of the node                                                |
