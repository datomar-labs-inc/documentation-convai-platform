## Usage

The one time broadcast is used to send an instant message to a user on any channel irrespective of the channel they are currently working on. It will only work if the channels are connected for the user.

## Example
If the user is currently connected on Facebook Messenger and you want to send a verification code via SMS, add a one time broadcast node, select Twilio SMS Channel, set up the broadcast type.

Then connect a Repsonse Node which is the verification code to the Trigger System Node via **[Broadcast Type Link](/convai-studio/links/broadcast-type-link)**, set up the broadcast type in the link's configuration. So once the bot's flow goes to the One Time Broadcast Node, it broadcasts a message with the broadcast type you set previously to the Twilio SMS Channel. The Trigger System Node receives the specific broadcasted type message. In Twilio SMS Channel the flow go to the Repsonse Node via **[Broadcast Type Link](/convai-studio/links/broadcast-type-link)**.
